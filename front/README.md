## Development Set-Up

Following the [general set-up steps](../README.md), here a few steps that make your live easier working on the front-end.

### Install node and pnpm

For almost all features of our development set-up you should also have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer. You will need it to run front-end tests and the formatters and linters in your IDE (e.g. VSCode).

We recommend you to install node through a [version control like nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). It provides you with much more clarity which version you are running and makes it easy to switch versions of node.

To install pnpm, see https://pnpm.io/installation. We recommend either using [npm global install](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm) or [Corepack](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack).

### Linting and Formatting in VSCode

We are using eslint as a linter and prettier as a formatter for the front-end. The configuration of these two is in the [`.prettierrc`-file](../.prettierrc) and [`.eslintrc`-file](../.eslintrc), respectively. There are two extensions for VSCode ([prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode), [eslint](dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)), which we recommend to to install.

The settings that these extensions are used are already defined in [`.vscode/settings.json`](../.vscode/settings.json).

The following commands need to be run for linting and formatting:

```sh
# auto fix
docker compose exec front pnpm lint

# check formatting
docker compose exec front pnpm format:check

# fix formatting
docker compose exec front pnpm format:write
```

### General linting and formatting rules

- 2 space tab
- reject unused expressions and imports
- trailing semicolon
- double quotes
- no deep nesting of loops (no loops in loops in loops)
- no console.log
- no debugger statements
- no vars
- interfaces/type should start with "I"

## Note about pnpm and Docker

We are using docker to spin up our dev environment. The front folder is in sync with the front Docker container. Therefore, the hot-reloading of the node development server should function.

When you wish to add a dependency, e.g. when you make a change to your local `package.json`, you will need to rebuild the docker container and relaunch.

You can add packages during development without rebuilding by installing it inside the container. Your changes will last until you `docker compose down` and will be saved on host for next build.

For example, to add XYZ to the `package.json` file in the `front` folder while developing, you can run this (make sure you run it in the project's root folder since docker compose is operating in that folder):

      docker compose exec front pnpm add XYZ

Afterwards:

1. stop docker-compose and run `docker compose up` again
2. run `pnpm i` in your local front folder (so that your tooling like VSCode also picks up the changes, like new TS types etc)

(This advice has come from https://github.com/BretFisher/node-docker-good-defaults)

## About Husky

`husky` is a git hook tool that we use to format and lint staged files on pre-commits. In case you use a version manager tool (e.g. `nvm`, `asdf`), or run into trouble commiting your code, consult https://typicode.github.io/husky/how-to.html#node-version-managers-and-guis.

## Testing

Testing is done with React Testing Library and Jest.

Test files are located in the same directory as the files they are testing. For example, `EditBox.test.js` and `EditBox.tsx` are both located in `front/src/views/EditBox`.

For integration tests, we mock the Apollo client with a `MockedProvider` component instead of the `ApolloProvider` component that is used to handle real data. More information on mocking the Apollo client can be found [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/development-testing/testing/).

To eliminate repetitive code, a custom renderer was built in `front/src/tests/test-utils.js`. It allows developers to render a component in a test environment where chakra, Apollo and Routes are wrapped around it. The utility also exports the entire react testing library, so you should import from this utility instead of `@testing-library/react`. See `EditBox.test.js` for examples of the custom renderer's use.

Tests and test coverage can be run with the following command:

```sh
# run tests
docker compose exec front pnpm test

# or locally
pnpm test

# test coverage
docker compose exec front pnpm test:coverage

# or locally
pnpm test:coverage
```

Here, a list of best practices you should follow when writing front-end tests with React Testing Library:

- [Common mistakes with React Testing Library](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library)
- [Write tests that simulate user behavior rather than single components](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-fewer-longer-tests)
- [Use the right queries in React Testing Library according to their priorization](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about#priority)
- [Maybe use this Browser extension to find the best query](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/testing-playground/hejbmebodbijjdhflfknehhcgaklhano)

## Mobile functional testing

Using Boxtribute with a mobile device is one of the main use cases, therefore we should do some functional testing of the work we are doing whenever possible.
Check https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/ to know how to debug local development with your Android phone. For Mac/Safari/iOS you will need a Mac and an iPhone simulator set up.

## Conventions for file and folder organisation

- Views of react-router paths go into the views folder
- Each view can have it's own folder - which in return can have a local components folder
- Following an "As local as possible, as global as needed" approach: components get only moved into a more global/outer folder if they are used on that level
- No index.ts files, besides the entry file for the app
- Ideally only one component per file
- Files and folders which export a component/view are written UpperCamelCase, with the same name as the actual exported component/view
- Other files (like types.ts, helpers.ts etc) and folders (like providers, utils etc) are written in lowerCamelCase
- Config constants should be UPPERCASE_SNAKES
- GraphQL queries, mutation and subscription **string** have the format UPPERCASE_SNAKES\_<QUERY|MUTATION|SUBSCRIPTION>

## Folders and files structures

The following rules and naming conversions can be used to name files:

```bash
|---- <NameOfComponent>Container.ts # GraphQL string definitions, Business Logic, Data transformation
|
|---- <NameOfComponent>.ts # only UI parts **views**
|---- <NameOfView>ViewContainer.tsx # main entry file the ReactRouter is referring to for a whole page including (maybe) GraphQL string definitions, extraction of URL params, ReactContext definitions (if needed), Business Logic, Data transformation
|---- <NameOfView>Query.ts # if GraphQL definitions are too long and should be singled out
|---- <NameOfView>Utils.ts # definitions of custom Hooks
|---- /components # subcomponents only relevant to this page
|--------<NameOfComponent>Container.ts # GraphQL string definitions, Business Logic, Data transformation
|--------<NameOfComponent>.ts # **only** UI parts
```

The folder structure is as follows:

```bash

/front
├── /src
│   ├── assets
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── <NameOfComponent>
│   │   |    ├── <NameOfComponent>Container.tsx

## Apollo

Apollo is our client to send GraphQL queries and mutation to the back-end. It can also be used as a local storage for global states. Here, some articles you might want to check out:
