## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to help@boxtribute.org with "SECURITY VULNERABILITY IDENTIFIED" in the subject. In the email, please describe:
1. The observed vulnerability and the expected severity in two or three sentences;
2. The steps to reproduce it (if available); and
3. Ideally, a suggested fix if you have one, including a reference to the relevant lines of code and associated files.

The team will get back to you on the status of your report and whether your proposal has been accepted as soon as we can.
