# ADR: Sync/Async architecture of the back-end

Decision Deadline: not pressing

Discussion Participants: @pylipp, @jamescrowly, @haguesto, @aerinsol

## Status

In progress.

## Context or Problem Statement

Python code is naturally executed sequentially by the interpreter. However Python 3 started to support asynchronous execution ("async" for short) from about 2015 onwards. This means that execution of code that would otherwise block program execution (because it has to wait for a network response or similar) is transferred to an execution loop, while the main code continues to run. Possible results from the execution loop will be awaited and resolved when available.

In more detail, the boxtribute back-end stack looks like this:
* the BE is a Flask app with a single endpoint that the FE sends GraphQL requests to
* the requests are processed by `ariadne` in an [async execution loop](https://github.com/boxwise/boxtribute/blob/3806009c131a270e9ccd9ecf1421e4cfd39ff2d8/back/boxtribute_server/graph_ql/execution.py#L66) (required by the `aiodataloader` package which supports with batch-loading. In turn, batch-loading is necessary to reduce database calls for GraphQL requests with nested fields)
* in GraphQL resolver functions, the sync ORM `peewee` is used to run CRUD operations on the MySQL DB
* in Google App Engine, the Flask app is invoked by the WSGI server `gunicorn`

**ISSUE** The codebase mixes async code at GraphQL level and sync code at DB level. In detail, [async batch-loading code calls sync ORM functions](https://github.com/boxwise/boxtribute/blob/3806009c131a270e9ccd9ecf1421e4cfd39ff2d8/back/boxtribute_server/graph_ql/loaders.py#L190) which results in [blocking the entire event loop (section "Sync from Async")](https://www.aeracode.org/2018/02/19/python-async-simplified/). I could indeed observe during profiling that processing a complex GraphQL request (for fetching the boxes on the ManageBoxes page) slows down during the batch-loading phase

## Considered Options

A. Keep current mixed state

B. Fully sync back-end

C. Fully async back-end

## Decision Drivers

1. **Maintainability and simplicity**: What's the team's experience? How straightforward is debugging of the stack?
1. **Stable ecosystem**: how mature do we assess the Python async ecosystem? How stable and well-maintained are core packages?
1. **Software performance**: how much does either of the options slow down or speed up code execution?
1. **Software consistency**: how important is it to get away from the current mixed state?
1. **Initial development cost**: how expensive is a possible migration to fully sync or fully async?
1. **Async use cases**: what is the estimated extent of I/O blocking code in the back-end (e.g. network calls to external APIs like Auth0)? Since async is a prerequisite for using ariadne subscriptions, how likely is it to integrate this functionality in the future?

### Experience reports

From the [ariadne GitHub forum](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne/discussions/1149):
- hypercorn + starlette, aiodataloader without ORM
- starlette/FastAPI/Mangum, aiodataloader, ORM: encode-databases or SQLAlchemy 2

**PRO SYNC**
> On async vs sync python: I kinda feel like you need a good reason to go async right now, it doesn’t feel mature. In a very I/O heavy environment sure, but in middleware code I just haven’t seen that need (generally the DB is doing the I/O lifting). There seems to be a push to go that route - uvicorn or whatever in front, and then Dj channels, Starlette, et al as you said - but there’s a lot of novelty and not much payback.

> Second the hesitance on using async python. I tried to dive into using async falcon for a little LLM thing the other day as a way to use python libs while not blocking threads forever waiting for the models. Felt like that scene from the simpsons with Sideshow Bob and the rakes. Edgecases, wrapped values etc everywhere. Libraries that claimed to be async but had just forgotten to wrap parts of themselves leading to hours long debugging. I’m sure it can be nice, but if you need something async use node or Elixir or something else where the ideas are more mature (I assume C# and Java these days as well, just really not my scene so can’t comment).

**PRO ASYNC**
> I’ve been happily using async python in production for years. I’m happy to talk details I’d you want to migrate from Flask to Quart (which should be the easiest path). I would agree that either an entirely sync or async codebase is best, mixing the two is difficult to reason about. As a disclaimer I’m a maintainer of Flask and Quart.

> “I would agree that either an entirely sync or async codebase is best, mixing the two is difficult to reason about. Came here to say this. Straddling the middle ground feels like a recipe for divided teams, knowledge, and understanding. I’m a big fan of Ariadne’s schema first approach. It feels right to me, in that you have a pre-agreed contract for the transport layer, in the same way that you would expect to agree a relational database table structure. Any teams that depend on it can work to it, and have confidence that it’ll be adhered to by providers/consumers. If not, you have bigger problems.

> Refactoring sync to async is clearly a bit of a pain, but I would argue it’s relatively mechanical and you can call out to async code pretty safely while you’re transitioning. Calling sync within async, on the other hand, is a world of potential mystery and intrigue that I would prefer to avoid - so e.g. the falcon uses are all sync, and falcon.sync_to_async() and friends all have a lot of caveats and therefore we decided not to use them.

1. 1y/o [If you could choose any Python web framework to build APIs for a startup, which one would you choose and why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/xs7s6a/if_you_could_choose_any_python_web_framework_to/):
    - Django for monoliths and CRUD apps: built-in database support and auth/authz
    - FastAPI for micro-services
    - but: FastAPI [maintenance](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/discussions/3970) [concerns](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/4263)
    - and: criticism on usability of FastAPI in production and its scalability
    - FastAPI alternative: [litestar](https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar). Very interesting for mixing [sync&async code](https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/migration/flask.html)
    - for data-heavy projects: skip ORM and use [aiosql](https://github.com/nackjicholson/aiosql)
    - Flask and Quart, both maintained by the pallets org. Great frameworks with strong backing
    - Starlette: simple ASGI done right. No extra bells and whistles
1. 4y/o [What's your Python production stack look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ddb1lh/whats_your_production_stack_look_like/):
    - not mentioning GraphQL in the replies

    - someone switched from Flask to Starlette; others positively mention Starlette, too
    - Django used often
    - not really comfortable with testing/debugging in async env, hence sticking with Django but considering using FastAPI for micro-services
    - FastAPI: use it for building a REST API with automatic validation and doc generation

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

**A. Keep current mixed state**
- (+) no risk of switching to unfamiliar packages
- (+) should be feasible to implement subscriptions
- (o) maybe possible to use `gevent` for improved performance (recommended by [peewee author](https://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/database.html#async-with-gevent))
- (o) the original issue stated above persists unless it can be circumvented with `asyncio.to_thread` or similar

**B. Fully sync back-end**
- (+) no risk of switching to unfamiliar packages and programming concepts
- (o) use a [sync batch-loading package](https://github.com/jkimbo/graphql-sync-dataloaders) (rather unpopular but recommended by ariadne in their docs)
- (o) must find work-arounds to call external APIs (e.g. threading)
- (-) uncertainty of using subscriptions

**C. Fully async back-end**
- (+) subscriptions are supported
- (+) calls to external APIs are non-blocking
- (o) little team experience with development of async Python
- (o) uncertainty about the hosting of the BE service because ASGI might not be supported in Google App Engine
- (-) risk and expense of replacing web-framework (Flask) and ORM (peewee) with async counterparts

### Details: Move to fully async BE

The most straightforward way seems to [replace Flask by its async counterpart Quart](https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/how_to_guides/flask_migration.html). This includes:
- async route definitions (no-brainer)
- add await to `request.get_json()` and similar (no-brainer)
- add await to testing client (simple since it's centrally defined)
- switch CORS package: instead of flask-cors, [quart-cors](https://github.com/pgjones/quart-cors) (maintained but only ~20 stars on GitHub; flask-cors has 850 stars)
- switch ORM integration: we use peewee's builtin `FlaskDB` utility to tie Flask and the ORM together. I couldn't find a similar utility for Quart and peewee-async. Implementing it ourselves is not too tedious I suppose (borrowing from [quart-db](https://github.com/pgjones/quart-db)) but I'd prefer to use a community-proven package
- **!!!** integrate it into the cloud: as an ASGI framework, [Quart cannot work with Google App Engine](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59277154/3865876) though some [claim it's possible](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/deploying-fastapi-application-in-google-app-engine-in-standard-environment-dc061d3277a) and `uvicorn` (most popular Python ASGI server implementation) documentation shows [how to setup an ASGI app with gunicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/#running-with-gunicorn)
